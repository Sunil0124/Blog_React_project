            "blogText": "There is so much talent and competition in the music industry that a strong mind could be your best asset in separating you from the pack. Also, this mental fortitude can help you overcome other obstacles as well.  Many mentally tough musicians battle physical odds/handicaps and become successful despite their disadvantages. For example, the late, great jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt lost use of his third and fourth fingers (on his left hand) in a caravan fire. This probably would have caused many musicians to quit and find new professions, but Django vowed to relearn the guitar despite his new handicap. He eventually emerged as one of the best jazz guitarists who ever lived, which is a testament to his strong mind. I’m not denying his insane innate talent, but his mental fortitude and unwillingness to accept defeat was the reason why he was able to bounce back. Now you may or may not have a physical handicap like Django, but the music business will find ways to throw adversity at you at a rapid pace. If you don’t adopt this survivor-type attitude you will most likely fall by the wayside."

            "blogText": "Nature refers to the interaction between the physical world and the life within it like animals, birds, trees, plants, and humans. It also includes non-living things like landscape, water, and others.The surroundings we live in, the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe in are all part of nature. Nature is the primary source of nutrition and nourishment for all living creatures on the earth. Water and oxygen are the essential things for all, and nature has provided us with plenty of both.The greed and selfish nature of humans have degraded nature by polluting it. Nature also provides raw material for economic development as well. In recent years, nature has shown her fierce face by way of drastic climate changes, earthquakes, floods, and global warming as a result of human greed. The time has come to realize the mistake and act in the direction of natural conversation. We need to maintain a balance between the ecosystem and life within. Many government and non-government organizations are working worldwide as well as within different countries to preserve and conserve nature. Life on earth is only possible because of Mother Nature, and it is now our duty to safeguard it."

            "blogText": "Is just the task of keeping your attention grounded to the motion of your own breathing as it’s happening within the present moment. You just need to observe yourself breathing, so get a near-full breath in each time & breathe slow so that your mind can observe the breathing motion easily, try to do this part without putting in a lot of mental effort. You need to hold your attention over your own breathing for as long as you can & you’ll know you’re doing it right when you’re mind stops telling you thoughts, like “this is boring, nothing is working. If you do it right, your mind will go completely quiet & you can pretty much feel your experience of reality to a higher level of detail without being distracted by self-driven thoughts."

Modern technologies have in fact succeeded in reducing the human effort and the risk in doing a lot many things. But, still, it is for us to see how best we make use of the technology available to us. While on one hand we can make use of technological advancements of nuclear energy to generate electricity and help many villages lighten us, at the hand the same nuclear energy can be used to create bombs which can cause mammoth destruction. Similarly, robots and other technological advancements have served as a good servant to us but the moment it becomes the master it can wipe off humanity from the Earth."
